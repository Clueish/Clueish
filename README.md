- 👋 Hi, I’m @Clueish
- 👀 I’m interested in muscle cars, and how modifying (Flashing) it's On board computer system changes it's entire attitude. I own a 2008 Ford Mustang I like to call 'The Phantom Menace.' Simply because I purchased it on a basic level, and ultimately unleashed its Dark Side by changing how the internal computer negotiates its commands on air/fuel ratios, spark timing and Limits on top speed. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Linux because I was caught with my pants down and ultimately allowed some jerk to completely take over my network and ultimately sabotaged my automotive business venture. I admit I was naive and thought that sort of hacking was reserved for government entities and Hollywood movies. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with someone who wouldn't mind teaching me or giving me feedback, because it's hard to teach myself a concept and not have someone to verify my understanding. Im not clueless and have some understanding, so im sorta clueish.
